This directory contains helper scripts and configurations for working with **tacplus-ng**—a modern implementation of a TACACS+ daemon based on the original event-driven TACACS+ servers. TACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus) provides central authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) for network devices.:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 📦 What is tacplus-ng?

**tacplus-ng** is a next-generation TACACS+ server that supports TACACS+ AAA, with flexible backends and configurability. It is often used to centralize network device login, privilege assignment, and command accounting.:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

This directory is intended to help you integrate, manage, or automate tacplus-ng deployment—not to *replace* the upstream project itself.
